Hey fellow graphic designers,

In these files, you'll find starter code for a basic website. It's nothing fancy, and it doesn't include all of the content with respect to accessibility, but it's formatted to help you get started.

If you have any questions about it, or need any help, feel free to tag me in your repositories @mackenzierose


Good luck coding!
